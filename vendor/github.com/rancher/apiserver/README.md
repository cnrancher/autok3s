Rancher API Server
==================

This repo contains the low level API server framework used to create REST APIs consumed by Rancher projects such as
github.com/rancher/ui and github.com/rancher/dashboard.  The primary usage of this framework is by github.com/rancher/steve
and probably does not have general applicability beyond that.
